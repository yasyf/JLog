Made an interesting discovery with my Pre-Calculus 12 teacher, in that when you are trying to find the log of x to base b on a TI-84+ calculator, you can input log(x,b) instead of log(x) / log(b).

This got us thinking on how the calculator treats the log button as a function to differentiate when it should be incorporating an alternative base, as it will also accept just the one (x) argument. Thus, JLog was born; this is how we think the calculator handles this button press, albeit not in Java.
